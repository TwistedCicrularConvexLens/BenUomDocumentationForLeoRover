<h1 align="center"> Following ARTag </h1>

In this section, you will learn how to perform an example application of tracking an ARTag with LeoRover. For this application, you are provided with an ARTag that will act as a target for LeoRover to follow. The example code has already been installed with LeoOS and the ROS package. You only need to launch the corresponding ROS node using the following command:

```
roslaunch leo_example_follow_ar_tag follow_ar_tag.launch
```
Now, as you move the ARTag, your robot should follow it.
